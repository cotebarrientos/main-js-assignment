## Project Purpose

The project consists of a **rock-paper-scissors game**, which you can play from
the browser console. The game has 5 rounds where you will confront the
computer. Can you beat the computer, or is it superior to you?

**Attention:** The index page is completely empty, you will have to play using the promp
window that will appear, and remember, don't forget to open the devtools to check the
console and consult the results.
